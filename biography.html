    <section class="biography">
        <p class="biography-text">I am originally from the Boston suburbs but currently live in downtown Chicago. I have many varied interests including playing the guitar, playing the piano, reading, traveling, working out, camping, learning pretty much anything, and of course coding!</p>
        <p class="biography-text">I have a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering and am working on my MBA. I spent the first 8 years of my career working in various engineering roles for automotive manufacturing companies. While I loved the work that I was doing, I felt unfulfilled in my personal life because I disliked working at manufacturing plants in suburban and rural areas.</p>
        <p class="biography-text">Because of this, I switched gears into technical sales so I could have the opportunity to live in a city. This change certainly satisfied my personal desires but took a toll on my professional aspirations. I found the work in technical sales to be monotonous and devoid of any intellectual satisfaction.</p>
        <p class="biography-text">I had been considering software engineering for several years and, after careful consideration of many options, I decided to pull the trigger on it. It fulfills everything that I am looking for in a career path and I could not be happier!</p>
