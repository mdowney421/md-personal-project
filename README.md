# Matt Downey's Portfolio Project

## Please note that this is NOT my official portfolio. That can be found [here](https://github.com/mdowney421/official-portfolio).

## Overview
* Home page: Welcome message and introduction about who I am. The welcome message uses jQuery to animate upon the page loading.
* Bio page: Picture of myself with a brief biography about me, my interests, my past experience, and why I decided to make the switch to software engineering. The picture of me includes a mouseover interaction.
* Resume page: This page includes an official, printable version of my resume. At the bottom, there is a contact me button that activates a modal with a contact form. The form is not currently functional.
* Projects page: The projects page is fairly straightforward. It currently only includes one project with a title and description. The picture is a link to the actual project.
* Header and footer: The same header and footer are located on each page. The header includes several buttons linking to each of the pages with a "Links" button that produces a dropdown menu for my GitHub and LinkedIn pages. The footer simply has a text box and more links to my GitHub and LinkedIn.

## Technologies Used
This project uses most of the major concepts of HTML, CSS, and jQuery. CSS was used for both general styling as well as responsive design for various screen sizes. CSS pseudoselectors were used for hover features such as the navigation bar sections and buttons. jQuery functionality was used for user interaction on the home page, bio page, resume page, and the "Links" submenu in the navigation bar.

## Approach Taken
I started this project by first coming up with the general types of pages to be included. After this, I put together wireframes of each page with a rouch idea of how I wanted them to be laid out. These can be found in the wireframing directory.

Once everything was laid out, I built the HTML structure and then moved on to the jQuery and CSS styling as I went along. Once most of the aspects of the layout and styling were complete, I added in the media queries for a responsive design.

## Unsolved Issues
The links submenu is the navigation bar works but it is not elegant. I could not figure out how to perfecty line up the submenu underneath the "Links" button at all screen sizes. Everything else in the project works as initially intended.
