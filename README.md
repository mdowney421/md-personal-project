# Matt Downey's Personal Coding Portfolio

## Technologies used:
This is a repository housing the personal coding portfolio for Matt Downey. This project uses most of the major concepts of HTML, CSS, and jQuery. CSS was used for both general styling as well as responsive design for various screen sizes. CSS pseudoselectors were used for hover features such as the navigation bar sections and buttons. jQuery functionality was used for user interaction on the home page, bio page, resume page, and the "Links" submenu in the navigation bar.

## Installation instructions:


## Unsolved issues:
The links submenu is the navigation bar works but it is not elegant. I could not figure out how to perfecty line up the submenu underneath the "Links" button as all screen sizes. Everything else in the project works as initially intended.
